Hello I am Going to do the practice on Git commands....

Added more line to know how the set upstream works for pushing a new branch named "practice" from local to remote.

Now i am going to add some line and push to it remote with the tag v.1.1.

One popular line from "Atomic Habits" is "Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become." 
This quote emphasizes how daily habits, even seemingly small ones, contribute to shaping one's identity and future self. 
It highlights the idea that consistent actions, repeated over time, have a significant impact on personal growth and development.
